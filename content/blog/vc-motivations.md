**VC is addictive.** Not because of the money — that comes later. It's addictive because of what you get access to.

## Front-row seat to the future

You get to see tomorrow's world **years before everyone else**.

I talk to founders building in AI agents, fusion, synthetic biology, defense tech, new energy systems.
It feels like living 5-10 years ahead.

Most people read about breakthroughs in the news.
I hear about them in pitch decks **before they exist**.

That alone is worth it.

## The people

Founders are the most intense, creative, and determined people I've ever met.

They are the misfits. The ones crazy enough to believe they can bend reality.
Helping them turn wild ideas into real things is deeply satisfying.

Not everyone gets this. But if you do, nothing else compares.

## Highest-leverage game

One good investment decision can create **tens or hundreds of billions** in value, thousands of jobs, and real technological progress.

Even if you only get a tiny slice, the leverage is **insane** compared to almost any other profession.

A single bet can change your life.
A single bet can change an industry.

## Getting paid to think

You get paid to be endlessly curious — read, meet people, form theses, bet on contrarian views.

It's one of the few jobs where being **"right when everyone else is wrong"** is literally the job description.

No boss tells you what to think. No committee approves your conviction.
You form a view, you back it with capital, and reality tells you if you were right.

> VC is not a career. It's a front-row seat to the future, a license to think independently, and the highest-leverage bet you can make with your time.
> **That's why I chose it.**
