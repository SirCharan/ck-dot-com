## Front-row seat to the future

You get to see (and help shape) tomorrow's world years before everyone else. Talking to founders building in AI agents, fusion, synthetic biology, defense tech, new energy systems, etc., feels like living 5-10 years ahead. Many VCs describe this as addictive.

## Working with exceptional, mission-driven people

Founders are often among the most intense, creative, determined people you'll ever meet. Helping brilliant misfits turn wild ideas into reality is deeply satisfying for certain personalities.

## High-leverage impact

One good investment decision can create tens or hundreds of billions in value, thousands of high-quality jobs, and real technological/societal progress. Even if you only get a tiny slice, the leverage is insane compared to almost any other profession.

## Intellectual freedom and the pattern recognition game

You get paid to be endlessly curious: read, meet people, form theses, bet on contrarian views. It's one of the few senior jobs where being "right when everyone else is wrong" is literally the job description.
