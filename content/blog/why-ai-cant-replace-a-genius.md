AI can replace manual human labour and automate repetitive tasks.

Jobs like an Uber driver, Zomato delivery guy, and many industrial, construction, transportation, and customer support roles can be automated in the blink of an eye.

But AI is incapable of creating independent thoughts.

Humans have the potential to create new knowledge.  
AI does not.

We have had people come up with strokes of random creative genius, producing multiple novel inventions and discoveries that have made our lives infinitely better.

If we go down in history and check, the inventions/discoveries of:

1. **Vaccine**  
2. **Bread**  
3. **Airplane**  
4. **Theory of Relativity**  
5. **Milking a cow**  
6. **Atom Bomb**  
7. **Alternating Current**  
8. **A reusable rocket**  
9. **Jio**  
10. **Apple**

Some of these things defy normal human/machine logics, first principles thinking, and basic laws of maths and physics.

**AI can never do that.**

What was the first guy who milked a cow thinking?

Why did someone inject themselves with a small dose of the deadly smallpox to prove that their theory of vaccines would work?

Theory of relativity and quantum physics defy all laws of normal physics.

A lot of these things came out of **randomness, boldness, idiocy, or creative genius**.

Because someone was crazy enough to believe in themselves to do it, and tell everyone else that they did it.

> Humans are the misfits, the crazy ones who "think different".  
> To do things AI can never do.  
> **That's why we need them.**  
> And that is why humans who dare to do it are **special**.
