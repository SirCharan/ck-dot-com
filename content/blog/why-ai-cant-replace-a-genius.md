AI can replace manual human labour and automate repetitive tasks. Jobs like a Uber driver, Zomato delivery guy and many factory, receptionist, sales and customer support jobs can be automated in the blink of an eye.

But AI is incapable of creating independent thoughts. Humans have the potential to create new knowledge, AI does not.

We have had people come up with stroke of random creative genius to come up with multiple novel inventions and discoveries which have made our lives better.

If we go down in history and check, the inventions/discoveries of:

- Vaccine
- Bread
- Airplane
- Theory of Relativity
- Milking a cow
- Atom Bomb
- Alternating Current
- A reusable rocket
- Youtube, Apple, Jio

Some of these things defy normal human/machine logics and first principles thinking and basic laws of maths and physics.

AI can never do that.

What was the first guy who milked a cow thinking?

Why did someone inject themselves with a small dose of the deadly smallpox to prove that their theory of vaccines will work?

Theory of relativity and quantum physics defies all laws of normal physics.

These are things AI can never do.

That is why we need humans.

And that is why humans who can do that are special.
