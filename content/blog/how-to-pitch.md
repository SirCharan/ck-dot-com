A simple 1-pager. That's all I need.

If you can't explain your company in one page, you don't understand it well enough.

## 1. Why this?

You can either be **better than the incumbent** or **build something entirely novel**.

**Better** — why are you better, faster, or cheaper than what already exists?

**Novel** — why do you think no one else did it before you?

If the answer to either is weak, the idea is weak.

## 2. Why now?

What has changed that allows you to do what you are doing **now**?

New technology? New regulation? New behaviour? A market shift?

If this could have been built 5 years ago and wasn't, I need to know why today is different.

## 3. Why you guys?

What's your skill set, interest, and skin in the game for building what you are building?

I don't care about resumes. I care about **obsession**. Are you the person who was going to build this whether or not someone funded you?

## 4. Evidence you can execute

Show me why you can execute on:

- **Product** — do you understand the user deeply enough to build something they love?
- **Tech** — can you actually build it, or are you outsourcing the hard parts?
- **Scaling/Sales** — can you sell it once it's built?

Talk is cheap. Show me what you've already done.

## 5. What will you do with the money?

Where will my money be used, and what will you have **before you raise the next round**?

I want to see a clear path from this cheque to the next milestone. Not vague "hiring and growth" — specific outcomes.

## 6. What is your unfair advantage?

What do you have that nobody else does?

Proprietary tech? Unique data? A founding team that's unreplicable? Distribution nobody else can get?

> If you can answer all six clearly on one page, you have my attention.
> **Most people can't. That's the filter.**
