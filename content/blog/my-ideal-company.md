Philosophy and ethics for building a company.

## Philosophy and Ethics

1. **Playing only a money game.** Targeting a $1-5Bn outcome in 2 years. Everyone in the company gets at least a 0.1% equity stake and comes out at least a millionaire when we are done.

2. **Anon company.** Everyone should be clear what they are here for. Nobody is here to build a network, become famous or gain followers. No vanity metrics or status games. Everyone is here only for money. Clear structure of hierarchy, ownership of individual roles.

3. **Alignment of Incentives.** Incentives of the core team should be aligned strongly with the success of the company. The core team should have equity allocations that increase as skin in the game increases, and in the case of a successful outcome, every member of the core team should end up a millionaire. Proper alignment of incentives helps everyone go above and beyond themselves and work for a larger goal. The outcome for everyone if this succeeds should be at least a million dollars — there is no nobility in fighting for a smaller target.

4. **Hiring for talent.** Only hiring folks who display qualities I consider essential for success — high IQ, unique specific knowledge, strong core value systems, high level of accountability, ability to work for a goal larger than themselves, unrelenting work ethic and ability to think logically from first principles. Skills can be taught and moulded, but IQ, personality, ethics and hunger is something inherent.

5. **First Principles Thinking.** All important decisions are motivated, made and justified via first principles thinking. Focus on not the end state, but the process as supreme. Process leads to roadmap leads to action leads to product. Mistakes are committed in the process, and failure is only identified in the product, so it is imperative that we have strong fundamental thought processes to weed out flaws which can creep up and be identified only later on.
