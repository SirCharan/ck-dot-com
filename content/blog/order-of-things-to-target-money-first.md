I think my order of priorities in life is:

1. **Money**  
2. **Relationships**  
3. **Health**

### Why do I put Money over Health?

This may make me seem greedy or materialistic. But to me, my thought process is completely logical.

I would much rather be me with multiple sclerosis and hypertension, than a poor healthy person.

I would never exchange my current life with a farmer, a labourer, or someone who earns 2-3 lakhs a month but can bench 100 kg.

They may have better health, better physique, no disease, and more mental peace than me.

But I still feel I would be happy if I had none of the above and had **100 crore** in the bank.

Because if I imagine a parallel universe where I didn't have MS and hypertension, and I ran my life from scratch…

…I still wouldn't be happy until I made it.

And probably, in the process of getting there, I would have again fucked up my mental and physical health and ended up exactly where I am now.
