# Writings

To create a new post:

1. Copy `_template.md` and rename to `your-slug.md` (the slug is the URL: `/blog/your-slug`)
2. Edit the front matter: `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, `tags`
3. Write your content in Markdown (supports GFM, math with KaTeX)

Files starting with `_` are ignored and won't appear in the index.
