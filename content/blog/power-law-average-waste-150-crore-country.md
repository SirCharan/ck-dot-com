In a country with a ~150 crore population, even being in the **top 1%** means you are still among 1.5 crore people.

Power law works dramatically in such large population sizes.

If you are able to stand out from this 1.5Cr too, you will be heavily rewarded.

The right tail of the curve is **exceptionally**, and sometimes **almost unjustly** rewarded more in a single day than someone's lifetime worth of effort.

The only way to live life is:

- Building **unique, specific knowledge**  
- Having an **irrepressible work ethic**  
- Taking on **accountability**  
- Possessing **strong core value systems**  
- Being **irreplaceable**

**There is no nobility in being average or poor.**

It would be a waste of a life to be just one in a crowd or just a statistic in the population census.

> Be legendary.  
> Leave a legacy.
