**Clubs, Wagers and Costs**

Premium, collateral, liquidation, Black Scholes model, options are all big words which most of the users of our platform, and even our own team doesnt grasp fully.

So a better way to understand Protected Perps would be to understand what happens in a club.

I (as a man) have to pay an **entry fees/cover charge** to enter into a club.  
That is the cost of entering into the game.

What is the payoff? Why am I paying this cost?  
To come out with a girl.

After paying the cover charge, there is **no loss** in this equation beyond that cost.  
Positive outcome for me would be coming out with a girl.  
And if I dont, I dont lose anything more than the cost I paid to enter this game.

**Same for Protected Perps.**

The trader pays a cost to enter into a game where they get paid out if ETH goes up.  
If it goes down, the trader loses nothing except the cost he has already paid upfront.
