If I were the product manager and designer for Protected Perps, I'd build **two distinct platforms**: one for sophisticated users like myself, and one tailored for the "dumb" crowd.

The "dumb" users can't handle numbers, percentages, calculations, or predicting the future.  
They have short attention spans, struggle with complex thoughts, and don't grasp crypto basics.  
They suffer from decision paralysis, low IQ, overwhelming greed for quick money, hatred for the system, and a deep need for revolution, community, hero worship, and someone to follow.  
They're happy to be led.

For them, we build a **simple, sleek interface**:  
- **No numbers** — hide all the math.  
- **Simple English words**, maybe sprinkled with **memic slang**.  
- **Minimal info displayed** — show only what's essential.  
- **Fewest inputs possible** — assume most things for them.  
- **Conversational copy** that speaks directly to their emotions and desires.

Key features to hook them:  
- **Copy trading**: Let them mimic the "heroes" without thinking.  
- **Social trading**: Build community vibes, where everyone feels part of the revolution.  
- **Leaderboards**: Show off wins to fuel envy and aspiration.  
- **Comparisons**: Highlight how much they'd have saved (or won) on Protected Perps vs. Binance.  
- **Zap feature**: One-click entry — make it effortless.  
- **Memes and slogans**: Use "YOLO" for upside bets, "NOLO" for no-loss guarantees, and phrases like "You only make profits."  

If we went 3D or immersive, imagine a **story mode**:  
A guy blessed with the ability to never lose, walking into a casino where **all losses are refunded**.  
It's gambling without the sting — pure thrill, community, and hero vibes.

**Make it mobile-first**: A true mobile dApp, optimized for quick swipes, notifications that feel like social alerts, and seamless onboarding.  
No friction, all addiction.

For the advanced platform (for users like me): Full numbers, custom controls, deep analytics — but that's separate.  
This way, we capture everyone, maximize fees, and turn trading into a feel-good revolution.
