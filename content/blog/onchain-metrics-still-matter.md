The on-chain analytics space has exploded. Glassnode, Nansen, Dune — everyone has dashboards. But which metrics actually lead to better decisions?

## The Survivorship Problem

We've all seen backtests of metrics that "would have" signaled the top. The problem: we're looking at history with knowledge of what happened. Out-of-sample and walk-forward tests are rare.

## Metrics I Still Trust

### 1. Exchange netflows (with context)

Large inflows to exchanges often precede sell pressure. But the *reason* for the flow matters. Are they depositing to sell, or to provide liquidity?

### 2. Miner behavior

Miners have real costs. When they accumulate instead of selling into rallies, it can signal conviction. When they dump aggressively, it's worth paying attention.

### 3. Stablecoin supply dynamics

Growth in stablecoin supply has historically preceded rallies. Contraction preceded drawdowns. The lag is variable but the direction has been persistent.

## What I've Abandoned

- **NVT ratio** — Too noisy, too many variants
- **MVRV as a timing tool** — Good for regime classification, poor for entries
- **Social sentiment** — Lagging and easily gamed

## A Simple Test

For any metric, ask: would I have traded this in real time with the data available then? If not, it's a narrative, not an edge.

## Final Thought

The best on-chain work I've seen combines a small set of metrics with clear economic reasoning. Less is more.
