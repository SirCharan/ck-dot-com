Some bets/predictions for the future.

## AI

- **Infra layer wins first**, then the final vision is a very user-friendly app
- Time for work goes down, free time goes up
  - 3–4 day work weeks, <6 hour work days
  - People find real work-life balance, explore other interests
    - Hobbies become structured
    - Retreats. Meditation. Find more means for calm & meaning
    - Focussed communities develop

## Capitalism

- Gap between rich & poor goes up
  - Growing unrest, push for charity, socialism increases
  - USA can lose its reserve currency status (WW3?)
- Unique human skills and specific knowledge stand out. <1% get disproportionately rewarded.

## Social Media

- **Authenticity beats AI replicability**
  - Creators rise multi-fold in value as:
    - Free time up, people consume more content
    - Marketing for consumer products becomes founder or social media creator driven
    - High investment follows in creators and creator economy ancillaries
- We see a social media creator in the 500 richest people
- AI enables unlimited content produced based on user's personal tastes and feedback loops, hacks attention, dopamine — large portions of population addicted. (Big opportunity?)

## Demographics

- Fertility rates go down, DINK is the new sexy
- Richer countries (USA, China, Europe) see fertility drop faster than poorer countries (Change of power?)
- Millennials become the first tech-enabled aging population
  - Elder care, old age retreats, communities up
  - Tech products for elderly up
  - Big opportunity for serving this section who is tech-enabled, and has a lot of money for which they have little use for

## Biotech

- Genetic modifications in food becomes common
  - Cosmetic surgeries, body modifications become common
  - AR/VR gains popularity first, then eye implants, brain-computer interfaces change how we view "screens" (mobiles, laptops etc)

## Green Energy

- Both a forced and much required change
  - Solar dominates, before nuclear takes over (infinite energy?)

## Crypto

- Loses out in value, some 5–10 crypto capture the entire market, rest everything dies a slow death
- Blockchain stays important, increases in value
- Crypto enables rails for shift in USA reserve currency?
