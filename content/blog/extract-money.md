**Mobile first. A real mobile dApp.**

How do I get money out of people's pockets the fastest as an owner of this product?

**Tell people no loss.**  
People won't believe it, so I need to create a few **incentivization scams** to make them believe it.

GMX awards a part of trading fees of the referee to the referrer.  
I will say: **I will cover your losses if you refer someone.**

I am never going to bow in front of anyone to ask them to use PP.  
It is **not a product we market**.  
Marketing it will only bring down its value.

**A god complex should be necessary** to build and sell PP.

**Dumb people don't know what to trade.**  
Give them **simple charts** with indicators and signals.

Build **auto trading bots** for them?  
Limit orders?  
Make **third-party services** for them that just take their money and keep making fees for us.

**Copy trading**?  
Star traders invite small retail to deposit into a pool.  
The pool follows trades of the star trader.  
How? Probably the star trader himself has to fill the pool with **20% of his own capital**, and then trade this pool as his own capital.

His incentives:  
- Part of the **profit**  
- Part of the **AUM**  
- Part of the **fees**

The second incentivizes him to bring more people and increase our volume.  
The third is just **directly money for us**.
