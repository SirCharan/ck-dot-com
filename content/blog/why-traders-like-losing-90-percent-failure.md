SEBI and Zerodha reports show that **>90% of traders lose** in options trading. Similar studies hold true for the US stock market, and by extension, crypto.

Trading options and futures is a zero-sum (actually **negative-sum**) game.

Someone goes long, someone goes short. Only one wins. 

The winner takes the loser's money and the government, broker, and intermediaries take their cut in fees.

In 2023 alone, intermediaries in the Indian stock market made **>$10 billion**. That money leaves the system, turning a zero-sum game into a heavily negative-sum one.

So why do traders keep trading options? Futures? Leverage?

I believe people trade for:

1. Adrenaline boost  
2. Fun of speculation + leverage  
3. Gambler's fallacy  
4. Martingale mentality  
5. Social status — to be part of the community  
6. Low IQ (or at least poor risk assessment)

### First-principles explanation

Think of an amusement park.

You pay money to ride something that gives you a massive **adrenaline rush** — a bungee jump from 100–200 ft, or a rollercoaster that feels like near-death.

You *accept* the downside: a tiny chance of serious injury, death, dizziness, puking, etc.  
You accept it because the upside — the thrill, the story, the fun with friends — feels worth it.

Parkour without a harness on top of a 100-floor building is the same:  
Upside is limited (bragging rights, adrenaline, social proof).  
Downside in a black swan event is catastrophic — almost certain liquidation.

Yet people still do it.

**That is exactly why so many trade leveraged derivatives.**

They are paying (with their capital) for the thrill, the dopamine hit, the status of "being in the game," and the fantasy of being the one who beats the odds — even when the math says almost nobody does.
