**Life is an exchange of payoffs.**

I always thought of life as a game.  
Every day I have to make decisions (big or small).  
I like to think of every decision as a game.  
Every game has a cost as input, and 2 or more payoffs as an output.

What I am today is the sum total of all payoffs I have accepted and costs I have inputted.

The choice to go drinking on a Friday night vs going to the gym is a decision.  
The payoffs for both are known.  
Every week a person makes this decision.

Every decision an individual makes in life is an exchange of payoffs.  
An individual makes an informed decision after weighing the pros and cons of every payoff available.  
What you are is the sum total of all payoffs you have accepted until this point in time.
